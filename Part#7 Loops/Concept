// Scope of local variables is limited to function in which they are defined but State variables can have three types of scopes.

// Public − Public state variables can be accessed internally as well as via messages. For a public state variable, an automatic getter function is generated.

// Internal − Internal state variables can be accessed only internally from the current contract or contract deriving from it without using this.

// Private − Private state variables can be accessed only internally from the current contract they are defined not in the derived contract from it.
