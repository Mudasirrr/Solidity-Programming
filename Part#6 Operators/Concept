While writing a contract, you may encounter a situation where you need to perform an action over and over again. In such situations, you would need to write loop statements to reduce the number of lines.

Solidity supports all the necessary loops to ease down the pressure of programming.

Sr.No	Loops & Description
1	
While Loop

The most basic loop in Solidity is the while loop which would be discussed in this chapter.

2	
do...while Loop

The do...while loop is similar to the while loop except that the condition check happens at the end of the loop.

3	
For Loop

The for loop is the most compact form of looping. It includes the following three important parts.

4	
Loop Control

Solidity provides full control to handle loops and switch statements.
