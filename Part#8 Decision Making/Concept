While writing a program, there may be a situation when you need to adopt one out of a given set of paths. In such cases, you need to use conditional statements that allow your program to make correct decisions and perform right actions.

Solidity supports conditional statements which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Here we will explain the if..else statement.

Flow Chart of if-else
The following flow chart shows how the if-else statement works.

Decision Making
Solidity supports the following forms of if..else statement âˆ’

Sr.No	Statements & Description
1	
if statement

The if statement is the fundamental control statement that allows Solidity to make decisions and execute statements conditionally.

2	
if...else statement

The 'if...else' statement is the next form of control statement that allows Solidity to execute statements in a more controlled way.

3	
if...else if... statement.

The if...else if... statement is an advanced form of if...else that allows Solidity to make a correct decision out of several conditions.
