# What is Solidity?
Solidity is a rather simple language deliberately created for a simplistic approach to tackle real world solutions. Gavin Wood initially proposed it in the August of 2014. Several developers of the Ethereum chain such as Christian Reitwiessner, Alex Beregszaszi, Liana Husikyan, Yoichi Hirai and many more contributed to creating the language. The Solidity language can be executed on the Ethereum platform, that is a primary Virtual Machine implementing the blockchain network to develop decentralized public ledgers to create smart contract systems.

The language has the same functionalities as C and JavaScript. Additionally, the language supports state variables (similar to objects in Object Oriented Programming), data types, and programming functions. However, the language faces consistent upgrades and rapid changes throughout the platform. Hence as a programmer, you need to pay attention to the updates through Ethereum platform forums, blogs, and chat rooms.

Both Solidity and Ethereum are under proactive development.
