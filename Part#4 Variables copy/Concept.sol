// Solidity supports three types of variables.

// State Variables − Variables whose values are permanently stored in a contract storage.

// Local Variables − Variables whose values are present till function is executing.

// Global Variables − Special variables exists in the global namespace used to get information about the blockchain.

// Solidity is a statically typed language, which means that the state or local variable type needs to be specified during declaration. Each declared variable always have a default value based on its type. There is no concept of "undefined" or "null".
